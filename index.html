        <h2 class="subtitle">Hi and thanks for visiting my new blog, There's a little about me and how I got involved in amateur radio. Also some other interesting projects.</h2>
        
        <hr>

        <p>My first discovery of amateur radio was in February 2024, when I was introduced to Nathan (2E0NNC) from my school. Since we both had an interest in computers and the like, he mentioned he had an amateur radio license and I liked the sound of something like that. What I didn't know was that I actually already had a Radio, the very common <b>Baofeng UV5R</b>... I bought it a few weeks prior for emergency preparedness as many people do, knowing that I can't use it unless there is an emergency.</p>
        <p>Soon after this, Nathan suggested I get my Foundation License. He suggested a course from <a href="https://www.essexham.co.uk/how-to-become-a-ham" target="_blank">Essex Ham</a>, so I took the course and successfully passed my <b>Foundation License</b> on the 14th May 2024, (Age at this time: 12).</p>
        <p>I made my first ever contact about 20 minutes after receiving my official license from Ofcom, on the popular repeater local to my area GB3LT, to <b>Steve M1CYT</b>. Who was very kind and was patient with my mic fright.</p>
        <p>I then went on to make many more contacts before coming off the air for a while. It was only when I first called out on the 2m calling frequency 145.500 that I spoke to <b>Matt Melling, G4IYT</b> and <b>Greg, Now M0YGL formerly 2E0YGL</b>. They were both very welcoming to the hobby after my short break, and encouraged me to join the <a href="https://www.verulam-arc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Verulam amateur radio club.</a></p>
        <p>Fast forward to about a year after getting my license in February 2025, I sent an email to the chair of the Verulam club <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/G7HMV" target="_blank">Matt - G7HMV</a> who encouraged me to join up!</p>
        <p>After joining and fast forward to now, all the members of VARC have been incredibly welcoming to me and encouraged me to progress in the hobby. I passed my <b>Intermediate exam on the 27th of this month</b> and am now the proud holder of the callsign <b>2E1SUB</b>!</p>
